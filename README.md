## Features:

## Installation:

Simply use npm or unpkg to install:

```bash
npm install monotone-shapes
```

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/monotone-shapes@1.0.5/src/app.js"></script>
```

then import using:

```js
import "monotone-shapes";
```

## Usage:

Simply use as web components:

```html
<monotone-shape shape-id="" text=""></monotone-shape>
<monotone-shape shape-id="1" text=""></monotone-shape>
<monotone-shape shape-id="" text="Some cool text"></monotone-shape>
<monotone-shape shape-id="1" text="" height="120px" width="120px"></monotone-shape>
```

It takes in the shape number or any string as input, which then shows the given shape as an SVG. If a shape id (any number between 1 to 24) is given, it will show the SVG for that shape. For string input in the `text` attribute, it will generate a unique SVG based on the text.

> [!CAUTION]
> Note: If both `shape-id` and `text` are given, `text` takes priority.

### Attributes:

| Attribute   | Description                                                                 |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `shape-id`  | A number between 1 and 24 to specify a shape. This is an optional attribute. |
| `text`      | Any string of text that will be used to generate a random SVG. If provided, it takes priority over `shape-id`. |

| `width`     | Optional. Sets the width of the shape. Default is `24px`. Example: `width="120px"`. |
